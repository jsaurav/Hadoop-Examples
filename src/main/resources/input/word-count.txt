We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves.
Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.
God has given you one face, and you make yourself another.
